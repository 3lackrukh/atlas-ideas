# Adaptive Training System

An intelligent system for analyzing model learning patterns and automatically enhancing training data to improve specific skills.

## Overview

This system provides:
- Analysis of model learning patterns
- Automatic identification of knowledge gaps
- Dynamic data collection and generation
- Adaptive curriculum management
- Skill retention tracking

## Key Components

### ModelAnalyzer
Analyzes how models learn and identifies improvement areas:
- Tracks weight changes during training
- Maps input patterns to model behavior
- Identifies weak spots in model capabilities
- Monitors skill acquisition and retention

### DataEnhancer
Automatically enhances training data:
- Scrapes relevant examples from the web
- Generates synthetic training data
- Validates and filters new data
- Targets specific skill improvements

### AdaptiveTrainer
Manages the adaptive training process:
- Coordinates analysis and enhancement
- Maintains training curriculum
- Balances skill maintenance and improvement
- Tracks training progress

### TrainingCurriculum
Manages training data and skill development:
- Organizes training data by skill
- Tracks skill importance and dependencies
- Manages skill retention
- Generates balanced training batches

## Installation

```bash
pip install adaptive-training
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

```python
# Initialize components
analyzer = ModelAnalyzer(ml_database)
enhancer = DataEnhancer(analyzer)
trainer = AdaptiveTrainer(model, analyzer, enhancer)

# Run training
async def train():
    results = await trainer.train_iteration()
    print(f"Training metrics: {results}")
```

### Custom Data Enhancement

```python
# Configure custom data enhancement
enhancer.scraper.add_data_source(custom_source)
enhancer.generator.add_pattern_template(custom_template)

# Set enhancement parameters
await enhancer.enhance_training_data(
    weak_spots,
    min_examples=100,
    max_examples=1000
)
```

### Curriculum Management

```python
# Configure curriculum
curriculum = trainer.curriculum
curriculum.set_skill_priorities({
    'skill1': 0.8,
    'skill2': 0.5
})

# Generate custom batch
batch = curriculum.generate_batch(
    maintain_skills=0.6,
    enhance_skills=0.4
)
```

## Configuration

Key parameters that can be tuned:
- Skill threshold levels
- Data enhancement ratios
- Batch composition ratios
- Retention requirements

## Performance Optimization

Tips for optimal performance:
- Use async operations for data enhancement
- Batch training operations
- Configure appropriate thresholds
- Monitor memory usage
